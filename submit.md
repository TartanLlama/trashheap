We want your trash.

Send us:

- Texts you sent to your crush at 4AM while drunk where you misspelled their name and they never spoke to you again.
- Flash fiction consisting entirely of the word "moist".
- Poems built around giving colours (especially purple) to things which don't have a colour.
- Draft Tweets which you thought better of sending.
- Badly photoshopped pictures of our website.
- Poems you wrote at 23:58 because you were doing a poem a day challenge and hadn't written anything yet.
- Your bank statement.
- The literary equivalent of a dude sliding into your DMs to say "hey".
- A medically-inaccurate explanation of the digestive system of Raccoon Dogs.
- A list of the contents of the nearest bin on your left.
- "Experimental" poetry which you created by shuffling the words around and spreading them around the page because that's what it seemed everyone else was doing.
- Love poems you wrote when you were 15 and thought you were the first person to ever compare someone's eyes to bottomless pools you could get lost in.
- Self-portraits made using raisins.
- Poems written by your cat.
- Your thoughts about your mother.
- Your thoughts about someone else's mother.
- Rewrites of song lyrics where you change every adjective to "horny".
- Any other trash.

If it's trash, we want it.
