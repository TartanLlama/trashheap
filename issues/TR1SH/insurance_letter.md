Dear REDACTED

Thank you for your letter dated 29/08/17 concerning the change of personal details on my home insurance policy.

I am writing to confirm that my preferred title is Mx - this is a title that has been in valid for many years now and is used by other financial institutions e.g Royal Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Santander, Co-Op Bank.

In your letter, you stated that you do not have an option for Mx, and that you cannot amend my details until I choose from the options you have available (none of which were appropriate).

I would like to point out that principle 4 of the Data Protection Act states ‘Data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date’.

 I believe that in order for my record with your insurance company to be accurate, it should reflect my correct title (Mx).

Please could you update my details accordingly.

Alternatively, the use of no title at all would be acceptable.

Thank you for your time.





Yours Sincerely 

Ely Percy REDACTED
