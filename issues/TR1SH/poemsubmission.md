			<&zwj;p>i just want people to like me  
      but im depressed and hate myself   
      so i stay up late drinking too much  
      cheap coffee and staring at burning  
      computer screens hoping that one day  
      someone will notice that its 3am and im  
      still at the office and im writing shitty poems  
      in HTML to look edgy even though deep down  
      i know im not edgy and my life is a lie and   
      im just a glob of cells on a spinning rock  
      waiting to fall into the sun <&zwj;/p>
