<p>11/10/17</p>
<p>Dear REDACTED</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter dated 29/08/17 concerning the change of personal details on my home insurance policy.</p>
<p>I am writing to confirm that my preferred title is Mx - this is a title that has been in valid for many years now and is used by other financial institutions e.g Royal Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Santander, Co-Op Bank.</p>
<p>In your letter, you stated that you do not have an option for Mx, and that you cannot amend my details until I choose from the options you have available (none of which were appropriate).</p>
<p>I would like to point out that principle 4 of the Data Protection Act states ‘Data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date’.</p>
<p>I believe that in order for my record with your insurance company to be accurate, it should reflect my correct title (Mx).</p>
<p>Please could you update my details accordingly.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the use of no title at all would be acceptable.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely</p>
<p>Ely Percy REDACTED</p>
