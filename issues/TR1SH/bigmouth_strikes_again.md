Declarative declarative osso bucco
Italian dressing dog cantata. Organic 
chicken aria exeunt, stage fright,
in minuscule green boxes, container
after container after Joan of Arc
in an interrogative convoy. How zinc
of you!, the gardener complimented
before we descended into the ever-
lasting sleep of the memory foam 
cabana. This is a very simple 
and simple way to make your body
feel comfortable; predictive text,
vodka and wheatgrass smoothies,
pastitsio made with the pinky toes
of goats, the end runs of desperate
lawyers around the end zones 
of your neighbor Gloriaâ€™s
magnificent calves. Exclamation!
