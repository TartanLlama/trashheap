I submitted an honest and from the heart poem  
to a journal that literally said they almost always  
take poems that are "honest" and "from the heart"  
and they rejected it (as well as all the other shit  
I sent about years of clinical depression and struggling  
with suicide (standard dishonest topics) and things  
I guess are never from the heart such as self-concept)  
so I fucked that poem into meaninglessness 1 and then  
that adaptation was accepted to a super experimental  
journal so all of this is to say u luv to c that ur art rly  
only matters if it doesnt actually matter *frat bro hand emoji wiggle*  
(U+1F919, to be mysteriously experimental, my main value now).  

1 this is the contrapositive of that same experimental poem  
that was accepted, shared here to exemplify its immense stupidity:  
m y uia ai ee eae eeie aiaie ea oae ae aai ey aea  
eui eaeu iao ai aia ooay eae oiee aiae eia m e
