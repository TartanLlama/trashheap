title: Sonnet about the fallen moon and morning star
author: Pawel Markiewicz
---

Heavenly sailorling spy out the wan light-sheen of star.  
Baffling unearthly time: weird having just thieved by elves.  
One of pale mornings longs for some meek fulfillment of night.  
Moony and nostalgic chums – comets are upon the skies.  
Lonely dreamery – lying just blink-sea, weird above.  
Endless nostalgia is being of pang. Hades is fay.  
Heavenly moony lure, beings seem dark, Ethics fly off!  
Poignant decease has become drab black, comet has picked rain.  
The glow, which is deathless, at length in the sadness full bane.  
Grim Reaper loves more than You dream – a bit lights of the worms.  
Marvel of starlit night: I have found a little of my name.  
Starry night – dreamy glow are only in the tender souls.  
Sensing the moonlet, demise of cool-blue song will be free.  
Your worm bawls after all certainly. Death blubbing like me.
