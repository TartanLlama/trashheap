How many times do I have to piss these sheets  
Before I get some goddamn sleep.  
I punch my vulva like that bitch owes me money  
And yet there’s no bruises, no pain  
One drop, two drop, three chocolate drops of THC  
I watch a shitty telenovela,  
Fast-forwarding until I see guns or crying  
That’s 25% of the show.  
But something has changed.  
What is that I see?  
Do my red bloodshot eyes deceive me?  
Hath mine brain melted permanent?  
Or does this intensely catholic show  
Contain a singular lesbian  
A sapphic creature  
A woman that desires the flesh of her own sex??  
My heart finds a joy lost  
Even in this molting rotten flesh of a show  
Lies even the smallest amount of precious gay  
I can’t watch anymore. My journey has ended  
Purpose was found in this discovery  
The weighted blanket crushes my paralyzed body     
Piss waits in the terminal of my broken bladder.  
Euphoria flows.  
Fuck these sheets
