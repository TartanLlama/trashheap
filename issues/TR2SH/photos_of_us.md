This is the last time I go through these photos  
Before I delete them all from my phone  
From the first selfie we took outside that bar  
To the last weekend we spent at your home  

Here’s one we took together on the bus  
As we traveled five hours to France  
You had to make me come to your house  
To ask your parents’ permission to take you out  

And these memories  
I’ll take with me  
For the rest of my life  
They may be erased  
From my phone  
But they’ll remain with me forever  

This one’s from the time we woke up late  
And traveled to the beach for the day  
We didn’t know it was going to be a nude beach  
After an hour we had enough, we had to leave  

So we hiked along the cliffs to somewhere new  
Made love in a field with incredible views  
We stopped at a beach to watch the sunset  
I knew this would be a day I would never forget  

And these memories  
I’ll take with me  
For the rest of my life  
They may be erased  
From my phone  
But they’ll remain with me forever  

My finger hovers over the button to delete it all  
But my heart is stinging as my stomach falls  
I don’t think I have the strength in me to forget you  
My finger’s shaking, mind’s racing, I can’t forget you  

But I finally submit, giving in to the pain  
I erased it all, including your name  
Now I feel an emptiness inside my chest  
An emptiness I know I will never forget
