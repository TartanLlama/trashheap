<p>This is the last time I go through these photos<br>
Before I delete them all from my phone<br>
From the first selfie we took outside that bar<br>
To the last weekend we spent at your home</p>
<p>Here’s one we took together on the bus<br>
As we traveled five hours to France<br>
You had to make me come to your house<br>
To ask your parents’ permission to take you out</p>
<p>And these memories<br>
I’ll take with me<br>
For the rest of my life<br>
They may be erased<br>
From my phone<br>
But they’ll remain with me forever</p>
<p>This one’s from the time we woke up late<br>
And traveled to the beach for the day<br>
We didn’t know it was going to be a nude beach<br>
After an hour we had enough, we had to leave</p>
<p>So we hiked along the cliffs to somewhere new<br>
Made love in a field with incredible views<br>
We stopped at a beach to watch the sunset<br>
I knew this would be a day I would never forget</p>
<p>And these memories<br>
I’ll take with me<br>
For the rest of my life<br>
They may be erased<br>
From my phone<br>
But they’ll remain with me forever</p>
<p>My finger hovers over the button to delete it all<br>
But my heart is stinging as my stomach falls<br>
I don’t think I have the strength in me to forget you<br>
My finger’s shaking, mind’s racing, I can’t forget you</p>
<p>But I finally submit, giving in to the pain<br>
I erased it all, including your name<br>
Now I feel an emptiness inside my chest<br>
An emptiness I know I will never forget</p>
