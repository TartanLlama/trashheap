I’m quarantined inside my room  
The country shut down because of a flu  
We can only leave our homes to go buy food  
And for some reason I’m only thinking of you  

I have big problems that are very grave  
But my mind chooses to be in another place  
I’m wondering if you’re watching a movie feeding  
Popcorn to another face  

Sitting in my bed during a quarantine  
A virus broke out and infected the world  
The country shut down almost everything  
And my only thoughts are of a girl  

Meanwhile no one can go out in the streets  
The police will stop you to pay a fee  
I just need to buy some toilet paper  
But really I need to walk to forget her  

I’m quarantined inside my home  
I still have two more weeks to go  
Two more weeks of feeling alone  
Fighting the urge to call your phone
