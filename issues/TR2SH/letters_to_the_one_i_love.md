[Not naming names but if we had a flirty thing going on between ages 16-18 this is about u, pls don’t hate me. Let’s be real, you won’t read it because we haven’t had contact in literally years BUT if you do hope u like it as much as I liked u xoxo]  

Dear you…  
love from me.  
A letter that you’ll never see  
Every vein, blood vessel, cell in my very body  
longs  
for  
you  
And I’m glad you’ll never see this,  
And I’m glad you’ll never know,  
that every essence of my being  

wants  
you  
so  

My heart pounds in my chest  
each beat makes me think of you  
close my eyes- press play  
re-run all our memories  

On the Pier  
waves crashing,  
eyes meeting.  
Two teenagers falling in love.  

Fast forward – prom night,  
dancing in the dark  
pause in that moment,  
when you and I nearly became us.  

Press stop.  

stop  
stop  
stop  

let our film end here,  
the story of us ending on a ‘what if’…  
not a never.  
That climax comes tumbling  
down and you lay there is the rubble of destruction  
broken.  
And those emotions you’ve bottled up come spilling out onto the page.  
The heartbreak of distance.  
The pain of what almost was.  
The fragments of my heart shattering across the paper ad I try to rebuild  
myself,  
knowing what could have been.  
An eruption of passion,  
where I’m the only casualty.  

It’s such a shame there’s no happy ending,  
in the story of what almost was us.
