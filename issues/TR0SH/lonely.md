Here comes the night again  
Will I make it to the end?  
Sleep holds thoughts  
I can’t erase,  
I pray for mornings  
Welcomed face,  
Days are long  
Nights are longer,  
The ticking clock  
Grows ever stronger,  
And now they’re here  
Those night time sounds,  
They circle me  
And laugh out loud,  
Water pipes and  
Neighbours fucking,  
Please hurry up  
And get it done?  
Jesus Christ!  
Where is the sun?
