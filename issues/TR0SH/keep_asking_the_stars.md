title: And I’ll keep on asking the stars to tell me what you meant
author: Gabrielle Hill-Smith

You say you are not ready for love,  
And I say I don’t know how,  

You say they were meant to be  
And I ask how we could be  

Just let me in, let me closer,   
let me take your hand  
turn and face the world  

Tonight we are barely breathing  
Tonight we are hardly seeing  
Anything except us two  
All around us are constellations  
And all we can see are supernovas  
We were destined to chart the seas,  
We were taught to take a chance   
When we saw it  
And we learnt to fly  

I am bleeding out,  
And your breathe is short,  
But we know the future is longer that we hope it might be  

I heard you talking about me, talking about me the other day,  
I heard you saying “I could love somebody like her”  

I heard some people talking about us the other day  
I heard them saying “They could work”  


Let us run down empty streets in the darkened night  
Let us run and laugh with stars in our eyes  

They say she is falling in love with him  
But he has forgotten how to love
