<p>The bright and calm day. Specifically the intensity of the sun was 900 W/m^2 measured by pyranometer and the wind speed was 1.2 km/hr or 2 mph for Americans.</p>
<p>Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s …</p>
<p>You were right the first time, it was a bird.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>From the white stuff on your shoulder.</p>
<p>I never sausage a day as this before.</p>
<p>So how is Jane doing?</p>
<p>She was doing great, but then she died.</p>
<p>Wasn’t she your wife or mother?</p>
<p>No, my cook. But the really important thing about her is that she always wore mauve.</p>
<p>Could you walk that back for me, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Fer sher.</p>
<p>Please tell me.</p>
<p>Sometimes she wore orange, but she was really tall.</p>
<p>I wonder how her death issue impacts the cook community.</p>
<p>It’s been painful talking to you, but I just got here and want to go. Odd that you are my best friend. I stan peeps that are woke, lit and extra.</p>
<p>Hello, I’m Jane’s sister Penelope with a P.</p>
<p>She told me about her monkey, but never a sister.</p>
<p>She had really bad eyesight and couldn’t tell the difference.</p>
<p>You ARE very hairy.</p>
<p>I made a lot of money as the before picture for Nair hair remover.</p>
<p>Say, Penelope, are you doing anything Saturday?</p>
<p>Not a thing. They take the chains off tomorrow.</p>
<p>What do you think of avoiding each other then?</p>
<p>Counter offer – I take Jane’s position as cook. She taught me how to make squid chowder and absinthe.</p>
<p>I hate squid.</p>
<p>So it’s a deal?</p>
<p>You bet, and it comes with a healthy stipend, 500 razors or a week’s worth, whichever comes first. Because I’m a razor burn freak, you can sleep in my bed on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>You probably need my social security number, ape – 99-0000.</p>
<p>So Duke, what would you like for your first breakfast from me? My specialties are uncooked pancake mix and sausage.</p>
<p>I guess you are my cook for batter or wurst.</p>
