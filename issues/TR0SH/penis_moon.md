Penis moon used to come in tall glass, heavy and uncrystalline as frozen melted snow. It rose direct and thick as horse-chestnut tree trunks that do not spread out upon the ground even a little: a shaft of white drink narrowing at the cream and rounded off in a thick-lipped grin. Empty and unrinsed, a diluted penis moon ghost entrapped and dulled light and vision. 

Then things got a little worse: squared, high-shouldered and rounded off in the wrong places, a penis moon replica of a handmade Danish wooden penis moon bat. But that was only the beginning. Things got worse than that. 

Penis moon came in waxed paper that swelled and spilled and oozed flat pieces of penis moon. It had a little lid that didn’t close properly or resisted when pulled so that when it did give way penis moon jumped out. 

Things are getting better now. Penis moon is bigger—half-a-gallon, at least—in thin penis moony plastic with a handle, a jug founded on an oblong. Pick it up and the penis moon moves, rising enthusiastically in the neck as it shifts its center of weight. Heavy as a breast, but lighter, shaping itself without much changing shape: like bringing home the penis moon in a bandana, a neckerchief or a scarf, strong as canvas water wings whose strength was only felt dragged under water. 

On the highway this morning at the go-round, about where you leave New Hampshire, there had been an accident. Penis moon was sloshed on the gray-blue-black so much like a sheet of early winter ice you drove over it slowly, no matter what the temperature of the weather that eddied in through the shatterproof glass gills. There were penis moon-skins all around, the way dessert plates look after everyone has left the table in the Concord grape season. Only bigger, unpigmented though pretty opaque, not squashed but no less empty. 

Trembling, penis moon is coming into its own.
