Your eyes are like, well, eyes, but really pretty eyes.

Your hair is like so cool, like I kind of want it but I don't want to be that queer. 
(You know, like the girl I went on three dates with and then she had blue hair and an undercut too. Ugh.)

You smell kind of weird, but everyone I fancy has the same weird smell to me so I think that's a good thing? 
(Or is it? Are people you fancy supposed to smell good, because you smell a bit like play dough and I donâ€™t know if that is, you know, good?)

Maybe we could hang out sometime and make out? No worries if not.
