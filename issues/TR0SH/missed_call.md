Next month XXX is moving into city centre (hopefully) - is that where you work from? Person 2: Who is this? To answer your question, I work just outside the XXX. 1: It's XXX sorry I should have said! I promise I'm not a rando stalker. 2: Thank god it's you and not some random! 1: Hope you're well soz for freaking you out. 2: No worries. Easy mistake to make :)." style="max-width: 100%;">
