<h4>by Gabrielle Hill-Smith</h4>

<p>You say you are not ready for love,<br>
And I say I don’t know how,</p>
<p>You say they were meant to be<br>
And I ask how we could be</p>
<p>Just let me in, let me closer,<br>
let me take your hand<br>
turn and face the world</p>
<p>Tonight we are barely breathing<br>
Tonight we are hardly seeing<br>
Anything except us two<br>
All around us are constellations<br>
And all we can see are supernovas<br>
We were destined to chart the seas,<br>
We were taught to take a chance<br>
When we saw it<br>
And we learnt to fly</p>
<p>I am bleeding out,<br>
And your breathe is short,<br>
But we know the future is longer that we hope it might be</p>
<p>I heard you talking about me, talking about me the other day,<br>
I heard you saying “I could love somebody like her”</p>
<p>I heard some people talking about us the other day<br>
I heard them saying “They could work”</p>
<p>Let us run down empty streets in the darkened night<br>
Let us run and laugh with stars in our eyes</p>
<p>They say she is falling in love with him<br>
But he has forgotten how to love</p>
