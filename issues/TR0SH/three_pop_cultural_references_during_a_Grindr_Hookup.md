"A hole is a hole..."  
_Like_  
_Love is love?_ 

We laughed,  
"But don't be silly  
and wrap your willy!" 

"While he pumped  
deep inside,  
I wondered  
if a hoe was a hoe?"   
(Carrie Bradshaw typing at her desk c. 1999)

"He had a bride  
on the side,  
and a kid  
on the way."

"Love is love, "  
he told me,  
as we fucked,   
"until it's gay."  
(Harvey Milk c. the shot of James Franco's ass in the pool scene, 1977?!!!!) 

"Then it's not."  
_I repeated it_  
_for clarification,_   
"then it's not?"

He wiped me off,  
looked me in the eyes  
and said:  
"Thanks, that was hot!"  
(Paris Hilton c. 2003 voice)
